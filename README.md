# MemoSeq

MemoSeq is a memory game that involves memorizing a sequence of shapes and numbers and entering the correct corresponding keys.

## Rules:
1) Players must match the randomly-generated number+shape sequence in the correct order using assigned keys on the key board within the time limit for each level.
2) The number of items in the sequence increases with each level while the time limit for each level remains the same.
3) Pressing an incorrect key or running out of time will result in a Game Over.
4) High score is the level reached when getting a game over.
5) Shapes mapped to WAD keys and numbers mapped to number keys.
6) The colors of the numbers and the shapes are also randomized.

## MVP List
1) Title Screen + Game Controls Screen

3) Countdown timer
4) Game Over + Highscore Screen
